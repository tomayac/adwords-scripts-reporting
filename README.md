AdWords Scripts Reporting
=========================

This project allows you to easily get started with AdWords
[My Client Center](http://www.google.com/adwords/myclientcenter/) (MCC)
cross-account reports using [AdWords Scripts](https://developers.google.com/adwords/scripts/)
and with the full expressive power of the
[AdWords Query Language](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/awql) (AWQL).

Setup Guide
===========

* Log in to the MCC account for which you want to create the cross-account report.
* Using this account, create a [new Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/).
* In [AdWords](https://adwords.google.com/), navigate to "Bulk operations" â†’ "Scripts",
and click "Create script".
* Paste the contents of the file ```mcc_cross_account_report.js``` into the scripts editor.
* Paste the URL of the spreadsheet from step 1 at the beginning of the script: 
```javascript
// Store the output here
var SPREADSHEET_URL = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ/edit';
```
* Fill in the desired AWQL ```SELECT``` fields, respecting the
[report guidelines](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports)
for your desired report type:
```javascript
// AWQL query
var SELECT_VALUES = [
  'ExternalCustomerId',
  'AccountDescriptiveName',
  'Clicks',
  'Impressions'
];
```
* Fill in the rest of the AWQL query, again respecting the
[report guidelines](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports)
for your desired report type:
```javascript
var REPORT_QUERY = 'SELECT ' + SELECT_VALUES.join(', ') + ' ' +
    'FROM   ACCOUNT_PERFORMANCE_REPORT ' +
    'WHERE  Clicks > 0 ' +
    'DURING LAST_30_DAYS';
```
* (Optional) Old rows in the spreadsheet will be auto-purged after ```n``` days,
so that the spreadsheet does not overflow with data. Adapt ```n``` accordingly:
```javascript
var PURGE_AFTER = 30 /* days */ * (24 * 60 *  60 * 1000) /* in milliseconds */;
```

Deployment Instructions
=======================

After setting up the script according to the guide above,
it is time to test it:

* Make a test-run of the script in
[Preview mode](https://developers.google.com/adwords/scripts/docs/concepts/preview)
by clicking "Preview".
* If all goes well, you should see logging output on the script console and data in the spreadsheet.
* If you get an error, the most likely case is that your AWQL query is invalid
  according to the [report guidelines](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports). 

If you are happy with the script's output, delete all data in the spreadsheet
and schedule the script to run *hourly*. This is important, as we can only process
[50 accounts per run](https://developers.google.com/adwords/scripts/docs/limits#mcc_scripts).

* On the Scripts page in the "Actions" column, click "+ Create schedule" next to the just created script. 
* In the drop-down box next to "Frequency", choose *hourly*. The script will process all accounts
  and stop once all accounts are done.
* Click "Save" and you are ready to go.

Possible Errors
===============

If the reports per account take longer than
[60 minutes](https://developers.google.com/adwords/scripts/docs/limits#mcc_scripts)
to generate, the script will get interrupted. Simplify your AWQL query in this case.

For all other errors, check the [errors](https://developers.google.com/adwords/scripts/docs/concepts/errors)
section of the AdWords Scripts documentation.
